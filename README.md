> Cause it all started with curiosity

eDirac is a non-profit project that aims to increase the accessibility of education and create completely free comprehensive sources of knowledge. We are guided by the idea that everyone, regardless of their origin and wealth, has a full right to education, and our goal is to provide all people with equal opportunities for a dignified life.

On the eDirac website, books are available that summarize current scientific knowledge in such subjects as physics, biology and mathematics. All of them are divided into fields of science and 4 levels of difficulty so that everyone can use them, no matter if they only need basic information or are studying a given subject.

Ultimately, the eDirac project plans to provide free education to every person in the world. To this end, free license-free textbooks translated into as many languages as possible will be created in the future. Currently, academic textbooks are usually expensive, and students are forced to buy dozens of different books on every subject. The task of our project is not only to create free books, but also so comprehensive that they will not need any other books.
